Hi Miguel,

Thanks a lot for the update, I have a couple of questions so I can put 
it in context.

So, if I understood right, this list only contains those PMIDs where 
text mining triplets, taken from EVEx; EuroPMC and STRING, overlap with 
the pathway/interaction resources listed in the second point. Is that so?

Also, you are still using all pathway databases as reference for a 
'positive' hit, and not using the predictions from IID or STRING, right?

I will do some evaluation on the new results as soon as I can and come 
back to you.

Cheers,

Pablo.
