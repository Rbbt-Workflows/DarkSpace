Not exactly. To be more precise the PMIDs are those that have TM triplets.
The only proteins considered for importance for a PMID are those for which
the same protein was associated with that PMID in pathway databases. The
triplet in itself does not necessary have to be in the database, but the
protein was found by the database in that PMID. You will see PMIDs with no
associated proteins, because there is no overlap between proteins in TM
triplets and proteins in database entries.

What is IID? For coverage of a PMID, which weighs down score, I use all
that is not TM. Perhaps I should not consider here STRING

Hi Pablo,<br>
<br>
I took the oportunity to have another go at our problem. Please find attach=
ed a new version of the ranking. It&#39;s based on the previous one with th=
e following differences.<br>
<br>
- For each PMID the proteins listed are only those that come from Text-Mini=
ng based predictions ie some TM method predicted that paper describes that =
protein as interacting with another<br>
- From the proteins above we only take those that are in triplets (PMID:Pro=
tein:Protein) described in one of the following resources:imex, reactome, B=
ioGRID, GO_IPI, OmniPath_interactions, OmniPath_ptm, STRING_pi,<br>
- Some PMID still have large numbers of proteins this is because both the T=
M methods predict many PPI and these are also used in the pathway databases=
 above.<br>
<br>
The rest of the calculations are the same.<br>
<br>
Let me know if this improves the result and also if I&#39;m missing somethi=
ng important from our discussions.<br>
