OK, understood. That's better than what I interpreted.

IID is a meta-database integrating interaction data from databases such 
as IntAct or BioGRID together with computationally predicted 
interactions. We have extracted only the predictions to integrate in the 
strategy. There is a part of STRING we integrated in the same way.

I think you are unaware of this because these columns in the integrated 
table I produced are not listed in those cases where PMIDs need to be 
taken into account. They can only be found in the table generated where 
only protein pairs are considered, no PMID listed. They could be 
integrated in the strategy as well, maybe in a future iteration.

I think that's it, I'll come back to you once I do my evaluation.

Cheers,

Pablo.
