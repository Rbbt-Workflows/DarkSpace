Hi Miguel,

Finally I could solve some GitHub issues and here's the amended version of the
email I sent this morning.

It took me a bit longer than I initially expected, as I have updated a few of
the datasets to include as much quantitative variables as I could. Despite
that, as you will see, most of the datasets included lack any quantitative
estimate.

For background, all the information about the different datasets of the project
and a brief summary of the strategy can be found in our GitHub site for the
project at https://github.com/pporrasebi/darkspaceproject.

We have produced a set of tables where we compare three different things:
interacting protein pairs, publications where interaction information is
reported and then a table where both the pair and the publication are taken
into account (if it applies: pairs taken from prediction sets do not have
publications associated with them). All these tables can be found in
https://github.com/pporrasebi/darkspaceproject/tree/master/dsp_comparison/results
(the tables you need are the gzipped files) and a description on how they were
generated can be found in
https://github.com/pporrasebi/darkspaceproject/blob/master/dsp_comparison/dsp_comparison_final.md.
I think you would need to start by having a look at the tables and then let us
know if you think you can help us to rank them somehow.
